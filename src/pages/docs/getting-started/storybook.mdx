# Storybook
Reablocks is designed with a Storybook-first philosophy, focusing on enabling seamless integration and development within the Storybook environment.
This guide will walk you through setting up Storybook with Reablocks, including the use of the `ThemeProvider` to ensure your design tokens are consistently applied across all your stories.

<Steps>
### Prerequisites
- Ensure Storybook is already set up in your project.
- Install Reablocks in your project (if you haven't already) using npm.

### Create or Update the `preview.jsx` File
The `preview.jsx` file in your `.storybook` directory allows you to customize how stories are rendered in Storybook.
If you don't have this file yet, you'll need to create it to incorporate the `ThemeProvider`.

- Navigate to Your `.storybook` Folder.
- Create or Edit `preview.jsx`.

### Structuring the `preview.jsx` file in Storybook with Reablocks
When incorporating Reablocks into Storybook, one of the key steps is ensuring your design tokens are applied across all stories.
This is efficiently achieved by using the ThemeProvider as a decorator within your .storybook/preview.jsx file.
Below is an example showcasing how we typically structure this file:

- **Import Required Modules:**
Start by importing the necessary modules, including the `DocsContainer` from Storybook's addon-docs, the `ThemeProvider` from Reablocks, and your theme file.

```jsx
import { DocsContainer } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';
import { theme } from '[INSERT_PATH_TO_YOUR_THEME]';
```

- **Set Up Decorators:**
Decorators are utilized to wrap stories for global style or functionality application. Here, we use the `ThemeProvider` to ensure that your design tokens are applied to every story.

```jsx
export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];
```

- **Configure Global Parameters:**
Define global parameters to adjust the Storybook environment according to your needs. This configuration includes setting the layout, customizing the documentation container to include the `ThemeProvider`, and hiding the no-controls warning.

```jsx
export const parameters = {
  layout: 'centered',
  docs: {
    container: ({ context, children }) => (
      <DocsContainer context={context}>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </DocsContainer>
    )
  },
  controls: {
    hideNoControlsWarning: true
  }
};
```

### Complete Example
Putting it all together, your `.storybook/preview.jsx` file will look something like this:

```jsx
import { DocsContainer } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';
import { theme } from '[INSERT_PATH_TO_YOUR_THEME]';

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];

export const parameters = {
  layout: 'centered',
  docs: {
    container: ({ context, children }) => (
      <DocsContainer context={context}>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </DocsContainer>
    )
  },
  controls: {
    hideNoControlsWarning: true
  }
};
```
</Steps>

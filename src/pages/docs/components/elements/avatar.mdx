# Avatar

The "Avatar" component is a versatile UI element designed to display visual identifiers for users, such as profile pictures or initials.
It's widely used across applications to personalize user experiences, especially in sections related to user profiles, comments, or team pages.

## Quick Start
To start using the `Avatar` component, import it from the `reablocks` library and provide the `name` prop.

<Runner code={`
import { Avatar } from 'reablocks';

export default function App() {
  return <Avatar name="Teddy Roosevelt" />
}`}
/>

## Examples
### Basic Usage
#### Displaying User Initials
The Avatar component can automatically generate and display initials based on the user's name.
For names comprising multiple words, it uses the first letter of each word. For single-word names, only the first letter is displayed:
<ToggleCanvas of={AvatarStories.Simple} storybook="components-elements-avatar--simple" />

#### Displaying Profile Pictures
When a URL to a user's profile picture is available,
the Avatar component can display the image within a circular frame, adhering to the common design pattern for user avatars:
<ToggleCanvas of={AvatarStories.RoundedWithImage} storybook="components-elements-avatar--rounded-with-image" />

## Theme Customization
The Avatar component comes with a default theme that can be customized.
The base theme includes styles for center alignment, background cover, and text styling, with an option to make the avatar rounded:

<ThemeRender theme={avatarTheme} />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API
Customize the Avatar component through the following properties:
<PropsTable name="Avatar" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Optimal Resolution:** For user avatars, ensure that images are displayed at an optimal resolution to maintain visual clarity without unnecessarily burdening the page load times.
Consider implementing a standard size for avatars across your application to create a consistent and professional appearance.

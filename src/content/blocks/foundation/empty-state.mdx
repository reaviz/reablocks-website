# Empty State

The Empty State blocks are useful when a component has no data to display. This is a common scenario when a user has just signed up or has not yet created any content.

## No Results
<StoryRenderer path="blocks/EmptyState.story.tsx" name="NoResults"/>

## Missing Info
<StoryRenderer path="blocks/EmptyState.story.tsx" name="MissingInfo"/>

## Nothing to Display
<StoryRenderer path="blocks/EmptyState.story.tsx" name="NothingToDisplay"/>

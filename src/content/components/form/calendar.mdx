# Calendar
The Calendar component is a versatile UI tool designed for date selection within web applications.
It can be utilized independently or integrated with other UI elements like search boxes to define time ranges for various actions.
This component is pivotal in applications requiring date inputs, such as booking systems, event planners, and analytics dashboards.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
This example demonstrates a simple calendar allowing for a single date selection, updating a display with the selected date or indicating when no date is chosen:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--simple" />

### Advanced Customization

#### Date and Time Selection
Allow to select both date and time, providing a comprehensive date and time selection experience:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="WithTime" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--with-time" />

#### 12-Hour Cycle
Allow to select time in 12-hour format, providing a more intuitive experience for time selection:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="WithTime12HourCycle" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--with-time-12-hour-cycle" />

#### Date Presets
Allow to select a date from a predefined set of dates, useful for applications requiring a specific date selection.
User can use the `presets` prop to define the presets.

```tsx
<Calendar presets={[
  { label: 'Today', value: new Date() },
]} />
```

<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="WithDatePresets" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--with-date-presets" />

#### Date Range Selection
Enable users to select a range of dates, useful for applications requiring start and end date inputs:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="Range" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--range" />

#### Restricted Date Range
Limit selection within a specific date range, enhancing usability by preventing invalid date choices:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="MinMax" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--min-max" />

### Initialize with Default Date
Automatically set the calendar to a specific date upon initialization, such as one month from the current date, guiding users towards a default selection:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="DefaultValue" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--default-value" />

### Day of week labels
Enhance usability by displaying day-of-week labels, offering users a clearer context for date selection. This variant is particularly useful for scheduling or planning applications where the day of the week is a critical factor:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="WithLabels" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--with-labels" />

### Range Selection
Implement range selection functionality within the calendar for scenarios requiring a start and end date, such as booking periods or event planning. This feature enhances the component's flexibility, accommodating a broader range of use cases:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="Range" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--range" />

### Multiview Calendar
Showcase a multiview calendar for comparing dates across multiple months simultaneously. This variant is exceptionally beneficial for long-term planning or date comparisons, providing a comprehensive overview of available dates:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Calendar.story.tsx" name="Multiview" storybookKey="components-form-calendar--multiview" />

## Theme Customization
The Calendar component comes with a default theme designed for adaptability and ease of integration:
<ThemeRender name="calendar" />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API
Optimize the Calendar component with a comprehensive set of configurable properties:
<PropsTable name="Calendar" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Efficient Navigation:** Ensure the calendar supports comprehensive keyboard navigation, enabling users to select dates without mouse interaction, crucial for accessibility and power users.

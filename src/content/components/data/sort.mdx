# Sort

The "Sort" component is a straightforward, user-friendly tool designed for toggling the sort direction of data within your application.
Ideal for data tables or lists that require sorting capabilities, it provides visual indicators for the current sort direction and allows users to change the sort order with a simple click.

## Quick Start

To start using the `Sort` component, import it from the `reablocks` library and provide the `direction` and `onSort` props.

<Runner code={`import { useState } from 'react';
import { Sort } from 'reablocks';

export default function App() {
  const [dir, setDir] = useState<SortDirection>('asc');
  return <Sort direction={dir} onSort={setDir}>
    Age
  </Sort>;
}`}
/>

## Examples

### Basic Usage

To use the Sort component, manage the sort direction state in your component or page and pass it along with a callback function to handle changes in sort direction.
This example demonstrates how to integrate the Sort component with ascending ('asc') and descending ('desc') sort directions:

<StoryRenderer path="components/Sort.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-data-sort--simple" />

## API

Customize the Sort component using the following properties:

<PropsTable name="Sort" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Sort Confirmation:** Provide immediate visual feedback when a sort order is applied, such as highlighting the active sort column or displaying a sorted icon, reinforcing the user's action.

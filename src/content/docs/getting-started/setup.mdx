# Setup
This section will guide you through the initial steps required to integrate Tailwind CSS into your project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can be customized to fit the design needs of your project. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth setup.

## Install Steps

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you already have Tailwind installed, you can skip 2nd and 3rd steps.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### 1. Install Reablocks

```sh copy npm2yarn
npm install reablocks --save
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you want to use `Reablocks` **prebuilt** theme, without customizing it, please import `reablocks` styles in your CSS file and skip the 6th step.

  ```css copy
  @import "../node_modules/reablocks/dist/index.css";
  ```
</Callout>

### 2. Installing Tailwind CSS
Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run the following command:
```sh copy npm2yarn
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

### 3. Import Tailwind in your CSS
Add the @import "tailwindcss"; import to your main CSS file.
```bash copy
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 4. Add Reablocks to your CSS as a source to be used by Tailwind
After installing Tailwind CSS, you need to inject reablocks styles into your project.
-  Open or create your main CSS file. This file is typically located at `src/index.css` or `src/styles.css`.
-  Add the reablocks as a source to be used by Tailwind at the top of your CSS file:

```css copy
@source "../node_modules/reablocks";
```
**Result:** The reablocks styles are now available to be used by Tailwind.

  ### 5. Configure Reablocks tokens for Tailwind
Import default colors tokens (primary, secondary, success, etc) in your main stylesheet file:

```css copy
@import "../node_modules/reablocks/dist/styles/index.css";
```

  If you would like to customize default colors, you can add every token from next files list with your custom values:

  - [Level 1](https://github.com/reaviz/reablocks/blob/main/src/assets/css/colors.css)
  - [Level 3 Dark](https://github.com/reaviz/reablocks/blob/main/src/assets/css/theme-dark.css)
  - [Level 3 Light](https://github.com/reaviz/reablocks/blob/main/src/assets/css/theme-light.css)
  - [Level 4](https://github.com/reaviz/reablocks/blob/main/src/assets/css/tailwind/colors.css)

Pay attention to wrap them in next selectors to keep it working.
```css copy
:root, :host {
  /* Level 1 */
  --neutrals-kyber-crystal-a-100: #e1e2e314;
  --neutrals-darth-abyss-a-100: #01010514;
}

:root, :host {
  &.theme-dark, &.dark {
    /* Level 3 */
  --stroke-neutral-6: var(--neutrals-kyber-crystal-a-100);
  }
}
:root, :host {
  &.theme-light, &.light {
    /* Level 3 */
  --stroke-neutral-6: var(--neutrals-darth-abyss-a-100);
  }
}

@theme inline {
  /* Level 4 */
  --color-select-menu-items-color-item-stroke-row-hover: var(--stroke-neutral-6);
}
```
  More details about tokens you can find here: https://unifydesignsystem.com/#process

### 6. Initialize Theme Provider
Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component from `reablocks`. 

```tsx copy
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'reablocks';

// NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

You can learn more about the `ThemeProvider` [here](/docs/theme/getting-started).

### 7. Setup Storybook
Optionally: If you are using Storybook, you can setup the reablocks in Storybook by adding the 
following code to `.storybook/preview.js`:

```javascript copy
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from "reablocks";

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    // NOTE: You can extend 'theme' with your own custom theme tokens.
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];

const preview: Preview = {
  // Your other configurations here too
  decorators: [withProvider],
};
```

You can learn more about the Storybook setup [here](/docs/getting-started/storybook).

</Steps>


## Example Repository
You can use the following [repository](https://github.com/goodcodeus/starter) to get started with Reablocks.

## Developing Locally

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development environment. To run it locally:

- **Clone the repository.**
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:reaviz/reablocks.git
```
- **Install dependencies.**
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash copy
npm install
```
- **Start Storybook.**
Once the installation is complete, start the Storybook development server:

```bash copy
npm start
```

**Result:** This command runs Storybook locally and opens it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:9009.` You can now view your components, experiment with their properties, and see changes in real-time.

### Building for Distribution with Rollup
Our project uses Rollup for bundling and preparing the package for distribution. To build the project, simply run:

```bash copy
npm run build
```
**Result:** This command generates a `dist` folder containing the bundled JavaScript, CSS files, and type definitions, ready for deployment or distribution.

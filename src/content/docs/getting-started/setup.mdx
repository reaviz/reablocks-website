# Setup
This section will guide you through the initial steps required to integrate Reablocks into your project. Reablocks ships pre-built CSS, so you don't need to install Tailwind CSS unless you want to customize the design tokens.
&nbsp;

## Install Steps

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **v10 Update**: Reablocks v10 offers three theme variants. The **default theme** (v9-compatible) requires no changes. The **Unify theme** and **custom theme** are opt-in. See the [migration guide](/docs/getting-started/migration/from-v9-to-v10) for details.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### 1. Install Reablocks

```sh copy npm2yarn
npm install reablocks --save
```

### 2. Import CSS

Reablocks ships pre-built CSS. Choose the theme variant you want to use:

#### Default Theme (Recommended for most projects)

The default theme uses semantic tokens and is v9-compatible:

```css copy
@import "reablocks/index.css";
```

#### Unify Theme (Opt-in)

For the Unify Design System theme with component-specific tokens:

```css copy
@import "reablocks/unify.css";
```

#### Custom Theme (Opt-in)

For maximum customization, use the `custom` variant with your own CSS file:

```css copy
/* Import your own CSS file - do not import reablocks CSS */
@import "./my-custom-tokens.css";
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Important**: Import only one CSS file. Do not import both `index.css` and `unify.css` in the same application. If using `variant="custom"`, do not import any Reablocks CSS files. Choose one based on your theme variant.
</Callout>

### 3. Initialize Theme Provider

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component from `reablocks`.

#### Default Theme

```tsx copy
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

#### Unify Theme

```tsx copy
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider variant="unify">
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

#### Custom Theme

```tsx copy
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';
import './my-custom-tokens.css'; // Your own CSS file

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider variant="custom">
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `theme` prop is optional and only needed for custom overrides. The `variant` prop determines which base theme to use (`"default"`, `"unify"`, or `"custom"`). Learn more about [theme customization](/docs/theme/getting-started).
</Callout>

### 4. (Optional) Customize Theme Tokens

If you want to customize design tokens, you have three options:

#### Option A: Use Pre-built CSS with Custom Overrides

Use the pre-built CSS and override specific tokens via the `theme` prop:

```tsx copy
import { ThemeProvider } from 'reablocks';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider
    theme={{
      components: {
        button: {
          colors: {
            primary: {
              filled: 'bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }}
  >
    <YourComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

**Why use custom variant instead of theme overrides?** The `theme` prop on default/unify variants still uses Reablocks CSS files (~19-35 KB gzipped). Use `variant="custom"` (shown in Step 3) when you want zero Reablocks CSS in your bundle, such as when integrating with an existing design system or implementing custom Tailwind configuration with your own design tokens.

#### Option B: Build Custom CSS with Tailwind (Advanced)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Advanced Use Case**: This option requires access to Reablocks source files, which are not included in the published npm package. You'll need to reference files from the GitHub repository or clone the repo locally.
</Callout>

If you need extensive customization and want to build your own CSS using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**:
```sh copy npm2yarn
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

2. **Create your custom CSS file** and import Tailwind:
```css copy
@import "tailwindcss";
```

3. **Import Reablocks source CSS files** (you'll need to copy these from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reaviz/reablocks/tree/main/src/assets/css) or reference them if you've cloned the repo):

For **Default Theme**, import:
```css copy
/* Copy these files from reablocks/src/assets/css/ to your project */
@import "./path-to-copied-files/tailwind/main.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/colors.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/dimensions.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/theme-dark.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/theme-light.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/semantic-tokens.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/variants.css";
```

For **Unify Theme**, import:
```css copy
/* Copy these files from reablocks/src/assets/css/unify/ to your project */
@import "./path-to-copied-files/unify/tailwind/main.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/unify/colors.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/unify/dimensions.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/unify/theme-dark.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/unify/theme-light.css";
@import "./path-to-copied-files/variants.css";
```

4. **Customize tokens** by overriding them after the imports:
```css copy
@theme {
  /* Override specific tokens */
  --color-primary: #your-custom-color;
  --background-brand-base: #your-custom-brand-color;
}
```

**Note**: This approach requires maintaining your own copy of Reablocks source CSS files. For most use cases, **Option A** (using pre-built CSS with theme prop overrides) or **Option B** (using `variant="custom"` with your own CSS) is recommended as they're simpler and easier to maintain.

### 5. Setup Storybook (Optional)

If you are using Storybook, add the following code to `.storybook/preview.js`:

#### Default Theme

```javascript copy
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "reablocks";

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];

const preview: Preview = {
  decorators,
};
```

#### Unify Theme

```javascript copy
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "reablocks";

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <ThemeProvider variant="unify">
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];

const preview: Preview = {
  decorators,
};
```

#### Custom Theme

```javascript copy
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "reablocks";
import '../path-to-your-custom.css';

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <ThemeProvider variant="custom">
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
];

const preview: Preview = {
  decorators,
};
```

You can learn more about the Storybook setup [here](/docs/getting-started/storybook).

</Steps>

## Theme Variants

Reablocks v10 offers three theme variants:

**CSS Bundle Size**
- **Default Theme**: Smaller (~145 KB / 19 KB gzipped in v10.0)
- **Unify Theme**: Larger (~310 KB / 35 KB gzipped in v10.0)
- **Custom Theme**: You control (your own CSS)

**Token Style**
- **Default Theme**: Semantic tokens (e.g., `bg-primary`)
- **Unify Theme**: Component-specific tokens (e.g., `bg-buttons-colors-core-icon-primary-background-resting`)
- **Custom Theme**: Your own design tokens

**Customization**
- **Default Theme**: Simple overrides
- **Unify Theme**: Granular control
- **Custom Theme**: Complete control

**Setup**
- **Default Theme**: Minimal (no configuration needed)
- **Unify Theme**: More configuration (requires `variant="unify"` and `unify.css` import)
- **Custom Theme**: Advanced (requires `variant="custom"`, your own CSS, and optional theme object)

**Recommendation**: Choose based on your needs and preferences:
- **Visual preference**: The themes have slightly different visual styles; compare them in [Storybook](https://storybook.reablocks.dev) to see which you prefer
- **Design system needs**: Use Unify for enterprise applications requiring granular design token control
- **Bundle size**: For marketing sites or lightweight apps where every KB matters, the default theme may be more appropriate (~16KB gzipped difference)

For detailed comparison and migration guidance, see the [migration guide](/docs/getting-started/migration/from-v9-to-v10).

## Example Repository

You can use the following [repository](https://github.com/goodcodeus/starter) to get started with Reablocks.

## Developing Locally

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development environment. To run it locally:

- **Clone the repository.**
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:reaviz/reablocks.git
```
- **Install dependencies.**
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash copy
npm install
```
- **Start Storybook.**
Once the installation is complete, start the Storybook development server:

```bash copy
npm start
```

**Result:** This command runs Storybook locally and opens it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:9009.` You can now view your components, experiment with their properties, and see changes in real-time.

### Building for Distribution

Our project uses Vite for bundling and preparing the package for distribution. To build the project, simply run:

```bash copy
npm run build
```
**Result:** This command generates a `dist` folder containing the bundled JavaScript, CSS files, and type definitions, ready for deployment or distribution.

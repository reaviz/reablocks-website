# Theme Icons
Out of the box, reablocks **doesn't** include any icons, however, you
can you use any icon library you want. This is because reablocks
wants to stay true to our core values of being unopinionated and
lightweight.

Reablocks offers helpers to make it easier to document icons
in your Storybook. Below is an example of how to use the helper components.

### Creating an Icon Loader
Begin by creating a file to load and organize your SVG icons. 
If you're using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you can take advantage of its glob import feature to dynamically load your icons. 
Create a file named `icons.ts` (or `icons.js` if you're using JavaScript) in your project.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const iconPaths = import.meta.glob('./*.svg');

export const icons = Object.keys(iconPaths).map(key => ({
  name: key.replace('.svg', '').replace('./', ''),
  component: React.lazy(async () => {
    const lazy: any = await iconPaths[key]();
    return { default: lazy.ReactComponent };
  })
}));
```
**Result:** This script dynamically loads all SVG icons from the specified directory, prepares them as React components, and exports them in a format compatible with reablocks' `IconBlocks` component.

### Documenting Icons in Storybook
With your icons prepared, the next step is to document them in Storybook. 
Create a Storybook MDX file named `Icons.stories.mdx` to showcase your icons library.

```tsx
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { IconBlocks } from 'reablocks';
import { icons } from './icons';

<Meta title="General/Icons" />

<style>
body {
  --icon-block-color: #fff;
  --icon-block-background: #000;
}
</style>

## Icons
<IconBlocks icons={icons} />
```
**Result:** This MDX file does the following:
- Imports the icons you prepared earlier.
- Uses the IconBlocks component from reablocks to display each icon alongside its name.

# Theme Customization: Button Example

This section demonstrates the customization options available for buttons within our `darkTheme`.
Our aim is to provide a flexible design that can be easily integrated across different parts of your application, 
ensuring consistency while offering room for customization.

### Theme Properties Explaination
- `base`: Sets the foundational style for all buttons, including text color, padding, and border radius.
- `disabled`: Defines styles for disabled buttons, including cursor changes and color adjustments.
- `fullWidth`: Adjusts the button to span the full width of its container.
- `group`: Customizes the appearance of buttons when they are grouped together.
- `adornment`: Configures styles for icons used within buttons, with size adjustments for small, medium, and large buttons.
- `sizes`: Offers predefined size options for buttons, affecting padding, font size, and line height.
- `variants`: Allows for different button styles, such as filled, outlined, or text-only.
- `colors`: Provides color schemes for buttons based on their intended use (e.g., primary, secondary, success, or any custom color).

```ts
import { PartialReablocksTheme, ButtonTheme } from 'reablocks';

const buttonTheme: ButtonTheme = {
  base: 'bg-lime-600 text-gray-300',
  sizes: {
    small: 'p-2',
    medium: 'p-3',
    large: 'p-4'
  },
  colors: {
    default: {
      filled: 'bg-lime-600 hover:bg-lime-700',
      outline: 'border-lime-600',
      text: 'text-gray-300'
    }
  }
};

const customTheme: PartialReablocksTheme = {
  components: {
    button: buttonTheme,
    // other components themes
  }
};
```

### Best Practices
- Use the `filled` variant for primary actions to draw attention.
- Reserve the `outline` and `text` variants for secondary actions or less prominent interfaces.
- Consider the context and background when choosing button colors to ensure sufficient contrast and accessibility.

# Custom Animations

The library provides a way to customize the animations of the components by passing the `animation` prop.
animate object may have the next properties:

- `initial`: The initial state of the animation.
- `animate`: The animate state of the animation.
- `exit`: The exit state of the animation.
- `variants`: The variants of the animation.
- `transition`: The transition of the animation.

You can read more about the animation object in the [Motion.dev](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animatable-values).

```tsx
<Dialog
  open={open}
  onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
  header="Custom Animation Dialog"
  animation={{
    initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, rotate: -10 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, scale: 1, rotate: 0 },
    exit: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, rotate: 10 },
    transition: { duration: 0.4, type: 'spring', stiffness: 150 }
  }}
/>

# Tools

### IntelliSense
Tailwind has a number of tools that can help you build your Tailwind projects more effectively.
One tool that is particularly useful is the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).

### Code Folding
Another useful tool is the Tailwind CSS code folding extension for
 [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stivo.tailwind-fold). This
 makes it easier to navigate your Tailwind CSS classes by folding them into a single line.

### What is reablocks?
Reablocks is a set of beautifully designed, highly customizable, open-source React components
based on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev). It combines 
the flexibility and ease of Tailwind CSS with the power of Motion to create
a seamless and intuitive experience for building modern web applications.

### Why reablocks?
There are many React component libraries out there, but reablocks is unique in a few ways:

- **Highly Customizable**: reablocks is built on top of Tailwind CSS, which allows for a high level of customization and flexibility. You can easily change the look and feel of your components by tweaking the Tailwind classes. No longer are you locked into a specific design system or its opinions.
- **Seamless Animations**: reablocks uses Motion for animations and transitions, which makes it easy to add motion to your components. You can create smooth animations with just a few lines of code.
- **Easy to Use**: reablocks provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to build modern web applications. You can quickly create beautiful UIs without having to write a lot of custom CSS or JavaScript.
- **Batteries-Included**: reablocks comes with a set of pre-designed components that you can use out of the box. This includes logins, reset password, manage team and more.
- **Battle-Tested**: reablocks is used in production on dozens of enterprise products and has been battle-tested in real-world applications.
- **Storybook-first**: reablocks is built with Storybook in mind. Every component is documented with examples and usage guidelines in Storybook. You can even easily import these stories into your own Storybook setup.
- **Enterprise focused**: reablocks is built with enterprise applications in mind. It includes features components that lend themselves more towards business applications than consumer applications.
- **Open Source**: reablocks is open-source and free to use and we plan to keep it that way. You can use it in your personal or commercial projects.
- **Real Code, Not Wrappers**: reablocks is built with real code, not wrappers around existing libraries. Everything from the select box to the radial charts are all part of the [reaviz](https://github.com/reaviz) portfolio.

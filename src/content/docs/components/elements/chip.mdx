# Chip
The `Chip"` component is a versatile UI element commonly used for displaying tags, labels, statuses, or categories. It's highly customizable, enabling the use of different types, colors, sizes, and even adornments like icons.
Chips can be interactive, allowing for selection or removal, making them suitable for various applications from filtering content to showing user selections.

## Quick Start
To start using the `Chip` component, import it from the `reablocks` library.

<Runner code={`import { Chip } from 'reablocks';

export default function App() {
  return <Chip>Active</Chip>
}`}
/>

## Examples
### Basic Usage
The Chip component supports several style variants such as "filled" and "outline".
This allows for clear differentiation between different chip types based on their 
purpose or context within the UI:

<StoryRenderer path="components/Chip.story.tsx" name="Variants" storybookKey="components-elements-chip--variants" />

### Advanced Customization
#### Colors and Sizes
Chips can be customized further in terms of color and size, providing flexibility to 
match them with the application's design theme:

<StoryRenderer path="components/Chip.story.tsx" name="Colors" storybookKey="components-elements-chip--colors" />

<StoryRenderer path="components/Chip.story.tsx" name="Sizes" storybookKey="components-elements-chip--sizes" />

#### Icon Adornment
Adding icons to chips enhances visual communication and can indicate additional functionalities like deletion or selection:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Chip.story.tsx" name="Adornment" storybookKey="components-elements-chip--adornment" />

#### Selectable Chips
Chips can be made selectable, allowing users to choose one or more options from a set:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Chip.story.tsx" name="Selectable" storybookKey="components-elements-chip--selectable" />

### Blocks
This component is used in the following Blocks:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card title="Not Found" href="/blocks/foundation/not-found" />
  <Cards.Card title="Billing" href="/blocks/administration/billing" />
  <Cards.Card title="Pricing" href="/blocks/administration/pricing" />
  <Cards.Card title="Profile" href="/blocks/administration/profile" />
</Cards>

## Theme Customization
The Chip component comes with a default theme, which can be customized according to your application's design requirements:

<ThemeRender name="chip" />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API
Customize the Chip component using the following properties:
<PropsTable name="Chip" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Dynamic Interaction:** For chips representing dynamic content (like filters), provide immediate visual feedback when the state changes (e.g., through animation) to reflect the action's impact.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Beyond color, utilize shapes or icons within chips to communicate status or category for those with color vision deficiencies.

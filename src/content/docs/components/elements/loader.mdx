# Loader
The Loader component acts as a visual placeholder, signaling to users that data is being loaded or UI components are in the process of rendering.
This component is especially crucial for enhancing user experience during initial page loads or data fetching processes, reducing perceived wait times through engaging animations.

## Quick Start
To start using the `DotsLoader` component, import it from the `reablocks` library.

<Runner code={`import { DotsLoader } from 'reablocks';

export default function App() {
  return <DotsLoader />
}`}
/>

### Basic Usage

Employ the Loader to maintain user engagement during wait times. Here's how to integrate a simple `DotsLoader` into your application:
<StoryRenderer path="components/DotsLoader.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-elements-loader-dots--simple" />

## Theme Customization

Tailor the Loader's appearance to fit your application's aesthetic with our customizable theme options.
The default theme includes flexible settings for base alignment, dot style, and size variations:
<ThemeRender name="dotsLoader" />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API

Optimize the Loader's functionality and style to meet your specific requirements with these configurable properties:
<PropsTable name="DotsLoader" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Visibility:** Place the Loader in a central, visible location to reassure users that the application is actively processing their request.

- **Contextual Use:** Select Loader sizes and speeds appropriate to the context.
For example, use smaller, faster loaders for inline loading states, and larger, more deliberate animations for page-wide loads.

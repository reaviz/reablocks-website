# Drawer
The Drawer component provides a hidden or off-canvas panel that can slide in or out from the edge of the screen,
offering additional navigation or content without obstructing the main interface. One common use case is when user
is analysing a list of entries from a table and they quickly wants to see details for some entries.

## Usage

The Drawer component uses a slot-based API for its structure. Use `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerContent`, and `DrawerFooter` as child components to compose your drawer:

```tsx
import { Drawer, DrawerHeader, DrawerContent, DrawerFooter } from 'reablocks';

<Drawer open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
  <DrawerHeader>Drawer Title</DrawerHeader>
  <DrawerContent>
    {/* Your content here */}
  </DrawerContent>
  <DrawerFooter>
    {/* Footer actions here */}
  </DrawerFooter>
</Drawer>
```

All three slots are optional - you can use any combination of them based on your needs.

## Examples
### Basic example
<StoryRenderer path="components/Drawer.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-layers-drawer--simple" />
### Drawer as bottom sheet
<StoryRenderer path="components/Drawer.story.tsx" name="BottomSheet" storybookKey="components-layers-drawer--bottom-sheet" />
### Custom Animation
Define custom animations for the drawer, using the `animation`, `animationViewChange` props:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Drawer.story.tsx" name="CustomAnimation" storybookKey="components-layers-drawer--custom-animation" />

Learn more about how to customize the animations in the [Custom Animations](/docs/theme/custom-animations) section.

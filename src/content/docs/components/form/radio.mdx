# Radio

Radio elements play a crucial role in UI/UX design by facilitating exclusive selection among a set of options.
This ensures that users can choose only one item from a list, streamlining clear decision-making processes and providing enhanced control.
## Examples
### Basic Usage
Illustrates a singular Radio button allowing users to make a choice with a simple click:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Radio.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-form-radio--simple" />

### Advanced Customization
#### Size Variations
Showcases Radio buttons in different sizes: small, medium, and large, accommodating various design needs and enhancing UI flexibility:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Radio.story.tsx" name="Sizes" storybookKey="components-form-radio--sizes" />

#### Disabled state
Demonstrates a Radio button in a disabled state, indicating non-interactive periods or conditions within the user interface:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Radio.story.tsx" name="Disabled" storybookKey="components-form-radio--disabled" />

#### Group of Radio Buttons with Single Form Control
A set of Radio buttons grouped together, allowing users to select one option from multiple choices, with a single selected value reflected in the application:
<StoryRenderer path="components/RadioGroup.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-form-radio-group--simple" />

## Theme Customization
The Radio component adheres to the following default theme, ensuring aesthetic consistency and visual appeal:

<ThemeRender name="radio" />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API
Tailor the Radio component's functionality to meet your project's requirements with a comprehensive set of properties:
### Radio
<PropsTable name="Radio" />

### RadioGroup
<PropsTable name="RadioGroup" />

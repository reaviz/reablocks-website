# Toggle
The Toggle component is a streamlined interface element that enables users to swiftly switch between two states, such as on/off or enabled/disabled.
It's especially valuable in settings and preference panels for toggling features or modes with a simple click.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
This basic example demonstrates a toggle that users can interact with to switch states. It's a fundamental illustration of the Toggle component's functionality:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Toggle.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-form-toggle--simple" />

### Advanced Customization
#### Toggle Size Variations
Showcase the Toggle component in different sizes—small, medium, and large—to accommodate various design requirements and enhance interface flexibility:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Toggle.story.tsx" name="Sizes" storybookKey="components-form-toggle--sizes" />

#### Disabled Toggle State
Illustrates a Toggle component in a disabled state, which is non-interactive and signifies an option that is temporarily unavailable:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Toggle.story.tsx" name="Disabled" storybookKey="components-form-toggle--disabled" />

### Custom Animation
Define custom animations for the toggle, using the `animation`, `animationViewChange` props:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Toggle.story.tsx" name="CustomAnimation" storybookKey="components-form-toggle--custom-animation" />

Learn more about how to customize the animations in the [Custom Animations](/docs/theme/custom-animations) section.

## Theme Customization
The Toggle component is designed with a default theme that can be customized to match your application's aesthetic:

<ThemeRender name="toggle" />

Learn more about how to customize in the [Theme documentation](/docs/theme/getting-started).

## API
Tailor the Toggle component's functionality with a suite of configurable properties:
<PropsTable name="Toggle" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Clear State Indication:** Design the Toggle with distinct colors or icons for each state (on/off) to clarify its current status at a glance. This immediate visual feedback is crucial for intuitive interaction.
- **Accessible Labeling:** While the Toggle inherently suggests binary choices, pairing it with accessible, descriptive labels ensures that all users, including those using screen readers, understand the context and implications of the toggle state.

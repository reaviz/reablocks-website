# Ellipsis
The Ellipsis component is designed to manage long strings of text by truncating them and optionally allowing users to expand the text to view in full. 
This component is particularly useful for maintaining a clean UI when dealing with potentially lengthy content such as descriptions, comments, or articles.

This ellipsis component supports 2 different modes of operation:

- Limit based on the number of characters
- Limit based on the number of lines

It also supports a tooltip mode where the full text is visible on hover and the ability to expand/collapse the text.

## Quick Start
To start using the `Ellipsis` component, import it from the `reablocks` library and provide the `value` and `limit` props.

<Runner code={`import { Ellipsis } from 'reablocks';

export default function App() {
  const longString = "Integer a aliquet ligula. Fusce vel eros libero. Sed dictum tincidunt hendrerit. Integer id neque faucibus, imperdiet purus dapibus, rutrum tellus. Nullam facilisis odio sit amet metus efficitur.";

  return (
    <Ellipsis
      value={longString}
      limit={100}
    />
  );
}`}
/>

## Examples

### Basic Usage
#### Expandable Text Section
In this example, the text is truncated with an ellipsis, 
and users can click on the ellipsis to reveal the hidden text:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Ellipsis.story.tsx" name="Simple" storybookKey="components-data-ellipsis--simple" />

#### Unexpandable Text Section
For cases where the full text should not be expanded within the component 
but is visible via a tooltip on hover:
<StoryRenderer path="components/Ellipsis.story.tsx" name="Unexpandable" storybookKey="components-data-ellipsis--unexpandable" />

#### Line Clamping
<StoryRenderer path="components/Ellipsis.story.tsx" name="Lines" storybookKey="components-data-ellipsis--lines" />

## API
The `Ellipsis` component offers flexibility through several properties that adjust its behavior and presentation:
<PropsTable name="Ellipsis" />

## Design and Usability Tips

- **Content Access:** Ensure the full content is accessible through interaction (click to expand) or tooltips, preventing loss of critical information.
- **Adaptive Text:** Adjust the amount of truncated text based on the context and importance, ensuring key information is always visible to the user.
